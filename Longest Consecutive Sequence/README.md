# Longest Consecutive Sequence

* Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence
(Optional) Your algorithm sound run in O(n) complexity

```
Example:
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4

Explanation:  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1,2,3,4].
Therefore its length is 4

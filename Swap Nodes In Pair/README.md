# [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. For example, Given `1 → 2 → 3 → 4`, you should return the list as `2 → 1 → 4 → 3`. Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

## Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:
* Q: What if the number of nodes in the linked list has only odd number of nodes?
* A: The last node should not be swapped.

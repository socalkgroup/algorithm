# Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i

* Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1. All elements may not be present in the array. If element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.
```
Examples:
Input : 
arr = {-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1}
Output : 
[-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]

Input : 
arr = {19, 7, 0, 3, 18, 15, 12, 6, 1, 8,  11, 10, 9, 5, 13, 16, 2, 14, 17, 4}
Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
```

## Solution:
Approach (Swap elements in Array) :
1) Iterate through elements in array
2) If arr[i] >= 0 && arr[i] != i, put arr[i] at i ( swap arr[i] with arr[arr[i]])
